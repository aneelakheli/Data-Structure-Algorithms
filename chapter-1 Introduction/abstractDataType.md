## 1.2 ABSTRACT DATA TYPES:

**Data Type** is a collection of values and set of operations on those values.
 Data types such as int, float, double, long, etc. are considered to be in-built data types and we can perform basic operations with them such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc. Now there might be a situation when we need operations for our user-defined data type which have to be defined. These operations can be defined only as and when we require them. So, in order to simplify the process of solving problems, we can create data structures along with their operations, and such data structures that are not in-built are known as Abstract Data Type (ADT).
 
**Abstract Data Types(ADT)**  is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations. The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.  
- It is called *abstract* because it gives an **implementation-independent view**. 
- The abstract datatype is special kind of datatype, whose behavior is defined by a set of values and set of operations.
