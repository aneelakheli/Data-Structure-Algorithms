# CHAPTER-1: INTRODUCTION

## DATA STRUCTURE
Data structure is a way of organizing all data items and establishing relationship among those data items.  It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.They are essential and responsible for organizing, processing, accessing, and storing data efficiently. But this is not all. Various types of data structures have their characteristics, features, applications, advantages, and disadvantages.
Data structure mainly specifies the following four things:
- Organization of data.
- Accessing methods
- Degree of associativity
- Processing alternatives for information

  >**Program = Algorithm + Data Structure**

## Classification/Types of Data Structures:
1. **Linear Data Structure**
2. **Non-Linear Data Structure**

### Linear Data Structure:
  - Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
  - Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

### Non-Linear Data Structure
  - Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
  - Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
