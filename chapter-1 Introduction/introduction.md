Data structure mainly specifies the following four things:
- Organization of data.
- Accessing methods
- Degree of associativity
- Processing alternatives for information

## Classification/Types of Data Structures:
1. **Linear Data Structure**
2. **Non-Linear Data Structure**

### Linear Data Structure:
  - Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
  - Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.

### Non-Linear Data Structure
  - Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
  - Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
