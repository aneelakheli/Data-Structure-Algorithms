## Structure

A structure is a collection of one or more variables, possibly of different types, grouped together under a single name. An array is a data structure in which all the members are of the same data type. Structure is another data structure in which the individual elements can differ in type. Thus, a single structure might contain integer elements, floating-point elements and character elements. The individual structure elements are referred to as members.

```
struct structure_name
{
member 1;
member 2;
...........
member n;
};
```

``` 
**struct** Student{
    **char** name[10];
    **int** roll;
    **char** sec;
    **float** marks;
};
```

## Structure variable declaration:
    **struct** Student s1,s2,s3;
